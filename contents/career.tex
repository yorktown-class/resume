    \paragraph{Map SDK \textit{TSMap}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                TSMap is a C++ map SDK used by vehicle softwares in TuSimple.
                It is used by over 100 packages.
                % It efficiently provides the required map data and information 
                The SDK is runing in the limited computing resources available onboard vehicles
                and provides required data in efficiency.
                Passed more than a thousand drive-out tests in my maintenance.
            \item 
                Developed Perception Drivable Map feature.
                It segments 2D map into drivable area and undrivable area, 
                presented as a matrix.
                The matrix helps perception algorithm efficiently determine whether a point is within the drivable area.
            \item 
                Developed Planning Drivable Map feature.
                It efficiently calculates the length of contiguous drivable area in physical on both sides.
                It can process 5000 queries in 1000 meters in 3 ms and can calculate asynchronously.
        \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{\textit{Map Pipeline}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Map Pipeline is a microservices system for map building
                that consumes raw sensor data, and products map data.
                I am responsible for development of a series of services that
                human intervention-less,
                stateless.
                These services support procedure input vector data 
                and output basedata including lanes, intersections, topology, phiscal element relations.
            \item 
                Developed major services in procedure that input vector data and output well structured map data.
                Them support to update build in differential content.
                Used C++ for computational heavy module,
                Python for communication with other services.
                And used pybind to combine the two part.
                Used jenkins for CI/CD.
                Applied unittest in GoogleTest and pytest.
            \item 
                Developed a few services to support
                converting data format for data producted in other pipeline,
                filling missing fields in raw input,
                merging divided map building task.
        \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Data compiler \textit{Great Map Builder}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Great Map Builder is a map compiler
                that consumes annotated vector data
                and products binary protobuf file
                which including lanes, intersections, topology, phiscal element relations,
                and can be directly loaded by map SDK.
            \item 
                I am responsible for maintenance and development of Great Map Builder
                as the primary developer after join the team.
                Developed feature and fixed bugs in map building.
            \item 
                Extended types of map elements.
                Supporting describe double line bounds, physical drivable areas, etc.
                Guranteed forward and backward compatibility.
        \end{itemize}
